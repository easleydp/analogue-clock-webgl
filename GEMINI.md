- README.md briefly specifies the purpose of the project.
- /docs/tech-spec.md is the technical specification.

The /src folder contains the source files. The code in /example-code can be ignored.

When implementing new features, don't take the opportunity to make unrelated changes to existing code unless they are relevant to the new feature. In particular, don't remove what you may consider to be redundant comments. Refactoring existing code is fine when this relates to implementing the new feature but please try to carry-over existing comments.

Target browsers: Only the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox and Safari need to be targeted.
